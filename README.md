# StopHuntDetector

This indicator detects and shows stophunts on the chart in metatrader5.
Create a new custom indicator and replace its content with this code, compile it and use it on any chart to show you the stop hunts.
You can modify the inputs when you are going to add indicator to the chart.
By default the number of bars to look in the rigyht and left for finding pivots is set to 20 and it just detects from 10 days before.
You can change both.
